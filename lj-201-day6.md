#Day 6 Learning J

The need for planning was highlighted for developers. Understanding the data we would need to represent in a program and how this would be stored and presented. Wire framing was alluded to. We then looked at the Document Object Model in more detail as related to a tree structure with nodes representing all the elements, attributes and text on the tree. Data structures were defined as the relationship between data and how its going to be stored and or processed. Two terms were introduced, traversing a tree and manipulation of the data on the tree.
We looked at Object Literal declaration with properties and the key/value relationship of these properties. Object functions or methods as we will refer to them were also discussed. The dot method os accessing and changing object properties was covered.
The use of getters and setters methods was introduced in relation to working with DOMs.
