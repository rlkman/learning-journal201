#Day11

Imposter syndrome day!!!
Looked at some virtual reality and augumented reality applications then at why companies particular platforms and then migrate to others. Also what choices the developers in these companies have.
We than had a look at the 401 modules on offer after a report back on the presentations last Friday.
Merger conflicts on Github were explained and how to resolve these. The bus-mall project was introduced and we looked at a wireframe for this and had to work in groups to generate user stories.
