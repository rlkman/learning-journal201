#Day 5

today we did a review of the work covered during the week including a thorough review on ACP cycle we use to maintain our version control of our code. We then attended a very informative presentation of the graduating 201 class. We then covered images, colors, texts before we did a through the process of publishing the web using github's server. The lab involved repetitive task on the use of Git as a recursive process for maintaining code and keeping back up.
