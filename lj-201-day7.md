Had an MLO - meaningful learning opportunity
Code review was most insightful as I had only partly completed the task an it had taken me ages to get done. Was very impressed with the work turned in by colleague. I need to work on my HTML and CSS more, also need to remember to keep my console.logs in my working code. WE looked as object constructors and how they reduce the amount of code needed and also how prototype functions are used to add functionality to objects.

We then had a look at the DOM and how we can dynamically change/generate content using JS. We created a table and used the week's scenario (Salmon Cookies) data to dynamically generate a table for the sales page.
